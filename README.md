Project Overview:
For this project, I created a Corner Grocer Application using C++, which aimed to manage and analyze item frequencies in a grocery store inventory. The main objective was to develop a user-friendly program enabling users to easily search for items, view item frequencies, and generate histograms using the provided input data.

Strengths in My Work:
I put a lot of effort into writing clean and well-documented code. I ensured that each function and method had meaningful names and clear comments, making it simpler for others to grasp and maintain the code. Moreover, I successfully implemented the features for item searching, frequency printing, and accurate histogram display.

Opportunities for Code Improvement:
While I'm proud of what I achieved, there's always room to enhance code efficiency. For instance, when creating histograms, I could explore more streamlined approaches to avoid unnecessary loops. By enhancing error handling and user input validation, I believe I could enhance the user experience and program robustness.

Overcoming Challenges:
One of the trickier parts was crafting the histogram display. It required careful attention to formatting and looping through frequency values. I managed to conquer this challenge by breaking down the process into smaller steps, testing each one individually before putting them together. Online resources and the C++ documentation proved to be helpful guides in clarifying concepts.

Skills to Carry Forward:
I gained valuable skills in crafting user interfaces, managing file input/output, and working with maps and data structures. These skills have wide applicability and can be carried over to other projects involving data manipulation, user interactions, and organizing effective code.

Making the Code Readable and Adaptable:
I paid close attention to making the code maintainable and easy to understand. I followed a modular approach by dividing different tasks into separate methods. Meaningful variable names and explanatory comments were used for complex sections. Consistent formatting and adherence to coding standards aim to enhance code readability and adaptability. Additionally, I designed the program to read data from external files, ensuring flexibility to handle various datasets without extensive changes.
